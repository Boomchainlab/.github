# 🚀 BoomchainLab – Official Organization Hub

**The Innovation Engine Behind CHONK9K, AGU Token, and Web4 Infrastructure**

> _“We don’t break records. We author the next protocol.”_  
> — David Okeamah, Founder, BoomchainLab

BoomchainLab is the core protocol engineering powerhouse building Web4-native ecosystems, zero-friction claim systems, multi-chain DApps, and smart contract registries.  
We ship secure, fast, and highly scalable infrastructure — all production-verified and continuously deployed across EVM and Solana.
